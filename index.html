                    <p>Mark Twain's wit, empathy, and gift for satire have made an indelible mark on American literature (and even, for those who believe 
                        in such a thing, on the American character). Although he achieved enormous success in his lifetime, Twain never lost his unpretentious 
                        nature, and his finely-tuned ability to detect the B.S. of others has bequeathed to the rest of us a hilarious and instructive collection 
                        of epigrams. Here are just a few:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"'Classic.' A book which people praise and don't read."</li>
                        <li>"Often it does seem a pity that Noah and his party did not miss the boat."</li>
                        <li>"The holy passion of Friendship is of so sweet and steady and loyal and enduring a nature that it will last through a whole lifetime, 
                            if not asked to lend money."</li>
                        <li>“I once sent a dozen of my friends a telegram saying 'flee at once – all is discovered.' They all left town immediately.”</li>
                        <li>"The political and commercial morals of the United States are not merely food for laughter, they are an entire banquet."</li>
                    </ul>
